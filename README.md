## Intro

I recently stumbled upon an [interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/eqzq1d/need_to_focus_try_i3quiet_mode/) [project](https://github.com/vrde/i3-quiet). It is implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and what it does is to offer a distraction free [i3 wm](https://i3wm.org/) experience. Even if not completely new subject, it reads very good!

Intrigued, to spice up my `sh`, `i3wm` learning experience, I wanted to check if/how I could implement it with plain `sh` script.

Turns out that it is possible (!) and not too difficult (!!): the most time consuming part for the first iteration (`alpha-workspaces-names` branch) has been to find why [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) behaved weirdly. Hint: I did not thoroughly `RTFM` (!?!).

For the current iteration (`beta-marks` branch) it was necessary a bit of gymnic to make the script behave correctly (load the placeholder) using `i3wm` keybinding.

Anyway, check the [known issues](#known-issues).

Suggestions, tips, help, etc are welcome:

even if this is a personal project (and it works already well for my needs), since it is publicly hosted I declare it open sourced (with a nice license).

### Rational

I had a few constraints in mind. The implementation should:

- start being relatively POSIX compliant (currently `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, improving)
- have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) as, eventual, only dependency
- need only one [key binding](#i3wm-configuration)
- restore the correct original position of the `focused` window

Personally I use `zsh`, I chose `bash` because `sh` generally is a `depends on os` soft or hard link to some other shell including `bash` itself, `dash`, `pdksh`, etc and a few more reasons.

In this way, the script should behave consistently on every system having `bash` installed.
Goal is to make the script full `POSIX` compliant.

Also, when leaving `focus workspace` without exiting `focus mode` (switching to another workspace/output as usual), the bar should:

- automatically and temporarily be [restored](#polybar-module) as [option](#polybar-configuration)
- automatically be [hidden](#polybar-module) when switching back to `focus workspace`/output
- automatically and definitely [restored](#polybar-module) when definitely leaving `focus mode`

About the `focused window`, it should:

1. [x] be restored to the `original workspace`, even if it does not exist anymore (window was the only one in `original workspace`)
1. [x] be restored to the `correct workspace`, even if it uses strange/weird names (this, hopefully, works)
1. [x] restored to the correct `original position`

Again, to enter/exit `focus mode`, to switch from/to `focus worksapce` should need only one [key binding](#i3wm-configuration).

### Install

Clone this repo somewhere:

`$ git clone https://github.com/maxdevjs/i3-focus.sh`

and include the `i3wm-focus` script in `i3` configuration file.

### i3wm configuration

Only configuration needed on [i3 wm](https://i3wm.org/) side is to add a keybinding to `/path/to/.i3/config`. Example:

```sh
# Focus mode
bindsym $mod+q exec $HOME/dotfiles/bin/i3wm-focus
```
That's all, folks!

Almost all: I do not use borders. If needed, add:

- in `activate_focus_mode()`

```sh
  i3-msg border none
```

- in `deactivate_focus_mode()`

```sh
  i3-msg border normal
```

### Polybar configuration

#### Polybar IPC

There are two supported ways to automatically show/hide the bar depending if `focus mode` is enabled or not.

The first and more verbose requires a module in `Polybar` configuration.

- enable [inter-process messaging](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Inter-process-messaging) in `Polybar` configuration file:

```sh
enable-ipc = true
```
Add the following module to `/path/to/polybar/config` (needed to manage bar state with `polybar-msg cmd show/hide` messages)

#### Polybar module

```sh
[module/i3-quiet]
type=custom/script
exec=$HOME/dotfiles/bin/i3wm-quiet-polybar
format=<label>
format-background=#282a36
format-foreground=#e6e6e6
label=Ôãê
tail=true
```
This module can be further stripped down. For example, no need for a visual clue in the bar to work.

With this configuration, the following behavior is offered:

- bar is automatically hidden when entering `focus mode`
- switching out of `focused workspace` without exiting `focus mode` (switching to another workspace/output as usual):
  - bar is automatically and temporarily [restored](#polybar-module)
  - switching back to `focus workspace`/`output` automatically [hides](#polybar-module) again the bar
- bar is automatically restored when definitely exiting `focus mode`

This method introduces a noticeable lag in showing/hiding the bar.

The second, simpler, way:

- solves the lag [known issue](#known-issues)
  - but when switching to another workspace/output as usual, the bar is not automatically and temporarily restored (only restores the bar when exiting `focus mode`).

I use the second method: lighter, faster.

### Output configuration

At the moment the support is very primitive and, most likely, will remain this way (unless kind `PR`s will manage it thoroughly).

To configure it, in `i3wm-focus`:

- at the end of `activate_focus_mode()`, add one of the following example lines:

```sh
  # Examples of primitive output support
  #i3-msg move container to output "HDMI-1"
  #i3-msg move workspace to output right
```

The previous examples should be adapted to the personal configuration.

`CHECK` - Not sure why, on multiple monitors configuration when moving the focused workspace on different output, when leaving focus mode, the window is correctly restored in the right workspace, but the now empty focus workspace is not automatically closed (see [known issues](#known-issues)).

### Dependencies

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

### Known issues

1. [ ] still not fully `POSIX` compliant script

1. [ ] to manage the bar
  - first method: using [Polybar module](#polybar-module) introduces a noticeable lag
  - second method: to use `polybar-msg cmd toggle` directly in `i3wm-focus` is very quick, but
    - to maintain the script simple, the bar is restored only when leaving `focus mode`

1. [ ] yes, currently only `Polybar` support

1. [ ] very primitive outputs support
  - when the [output](#output-configuration) support is enabled and the focus workspace is then moved to another output
    - when leaving `focus mode`
      - the `focus workspace` is not automatically closed
        - /shrug

1. [ ] `WIP` (this should already be solved, probably found out the issue) - unable to split the script in proper script file + configuration file:
  - works from terminal
  - completely ignored when using key binding

1. [x] Solved - using a placeholder ~~when exiting focus mode, the window does not automatically goes back to original stack position. To restore an i3 [layout](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) is not straightforward and not a priority for this project (unless a `PR` will do it).~~

1. [x] Solved - current version uses exclusively `marks` ~~a temp file (`/tmp/i3-focus.tmp`) holds the original workspace name~~

1. [ ] OPS - yes, screenshot taken with `scrot`...

### Inspiration

[vrde/i3-quiet](https://github.com/vrde/i3-quiet)

### TODO

1. [ ] some ideas, but this is still an experiment
1. [ ] to split the script in proper script file + configuration file would be a nice thing
1. [ ] activate `focus mode` when launching a specific application, as a `PDF` viewer.
